# Stack Implementation in C

This project implements a basic stack data structure in C. The stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This implementation provides a simple yet comprehensive example of how to work with stacks in the C programming language.

## Features

- **Dynamic Size**: Although a maximum stack size is defined, the stack can be modified to dynamically resize based on needs.
- **Basic Operations**: Includes essential stack operations such as push, pop, and peek.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling for common stack operations, including stack overflow and underflow.

## Getting Started

To get started with this stack implementation, you will need a C compiler installed on your system. This project has been tested with GCC, but any standard C compiler should work.

### Compilation

To compile the program, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
gcc main.c -o stack


### Running the Program
After compiling, you can run the program using:

### Usage
The main functionality of the stack is encapsulated in the main.c file. This file includes the implementation of the stack and basic operations such as:

push(int): Adds an element to the top of the stack.
pop(): Removes the top element from the stack.
peek(): Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
